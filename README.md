# Spam Email Classifier

The Spam Email Classifier is a machine learning project that automatically classifies emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model uses text vectorization techniques and machine learning algorithms to filter out unwanted emails, helping to improve email organization and reduce clutter. A Streamlit app is also provided to interact with the model via a web interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms
- Pandas and NumPy: For data handling and manipulation
- NLTK: For text preprocessing
- Streamlit: For creating the web app interface

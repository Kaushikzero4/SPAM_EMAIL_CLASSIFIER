# Spam Email Classifier

The Spam Email Classifier is a machine learning project that automatically classifies emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model uses text vectorization techniques and machine learning algorithms to filter out unwanted emails, helping to improve email organization and reduce clutter. A Streamlit app is also provided to interact with the model via a web interface.

## Features

- Classifies emails as spam or ham (non-spam)
- Text preprocessing using NLTK
- Machine learning model built using Scikit-learn
- Web interface created using Streamlit for easy interaction
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms
- Pandas and NumPy: For data handling and manipulation
- NLTK: For text preprocessing
- Streamlit: For creating the web app interface

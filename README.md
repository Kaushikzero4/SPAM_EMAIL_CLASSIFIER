# SPAM_EMAIL_CLASSIFIER
The Spam Email Classifier is a machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or ham (non-spam). It uses text vectorization and machine learning models to classify emails. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, helping automate email filtering to reduce unwanted messages.
